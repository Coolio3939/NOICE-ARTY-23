    <h2>Let me get you ready for some basics, shall I?</h2>
    
    <h2> - Cyberbullying can happen in many forms, ranging from leaking private info about somebody without their consent to sending mean texts about somebody.</h2>
    
    <h2> Cyberbullying is quite a serious issue; consequences can range from anxiety to having suicidal thoughts, or actually doing it.</h2>
    
    <h2> If you are a person on a group chat for example seeing a cyberbully in action, DO NOT join in or DO NOT become a bystander. Instead, straight away report it to a trusted adult.</h2>

    <h2>54% of Girls aged 15-17 have experienced cyberbullying. Now the reason girls face more cyberbullying than boys is because of sexism. Pretty sad it exists in 2024 but oh well.</h2>
    
    <h2>Another distressing fact- Approx 90% of teens who face cyberbullying.... are AFRAID TO REPORT IT! In fear of being labeled a "snitch". Frankly speaking, who cares the cyberbully deserves to be reported anyway.</h2>
    
    <h2> Latching on from the last fact; 13.6% of teenagers who have been cyberbullied have tried to end it all. Yup, think about it, in a cyberbullying-free world this % would be 0.</h2>
    
    <h2> And finally to all the people addicted to social media (let's be honest, everybody is here), the most damaging app in terms of cyberbullying is Instagram. I mean... not a surprise, have you seen the Insta Reels comment section? Something straight out of a horror movie.</h2>

    <h2>Let's learn some key points on how to combat cyberbullying</h2>
    <h2>For one, you can make your accounts private by altering your privacy settings, which also includes selective friend requests and photo tag approvl</h2>
    <h2>Also remember, whenever you want to post stuff online; consider if it leaks any private information. If it does, then DO NOT post it, it doesnt matter if you friends find it funny, a cyberbully will nevertheless exploit it  </h2>
    <h2> If someone sends you many mean messages on online messaging apps; DO NOT retaliate against the cyberbully! No that will make everything even worse! Instead, take screenshots</h2>
